Hi if your new to batch or dont know what commands do what read this.
also thanks for watching my video and supporting my channel.
if you dont mind a like and sub would help alot and I will continue making code like this and more!

ALSO READ THE readme.md

Under Here its going to be the code than -- to explain what they do! than underneath its going to be an example

echo -- this is what your going to use to type stuff out in the cmd terminal or whatevr you want to call it. it should look sum like this

echo Hello World

@echo off -- this is what you are going to use to make it cleaner with it off it would look like this

without command

C:\users\username>Hello World

with command

Hello World

color -- this is used to change colors for text i will provide a table underneath this

    0 = Black       8 = Gray
    1 = Blue        9 = Light Blue
    2 = Green       A = Light Green
    3 = Aqua        B = Light Aqua
    4 = Red         C = Light Red
    5 = Purple      D = Light Purple
    6 = Yellow      E = Light Yellow
    7 = White       F = Bright White

using these the command should look something like this

color 5 -- for a purple text

if you want a colored text and backgeound it should look something like this

color 5d

title -- its in the command

title hello -- on the top of the cmd / terminal it should say hello instead of cmd or whatevr

cls -- clears all the text but keeps the title color etc

cls

ping localhost -n (any number) >nul this is what is used to make an animation it would pause the code for how many seconds than will go back to it not being paused

echo LOADING.
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls
echo LOADING..
ping localhost -n 2 >nul
cls

>nul -- this is used to make things not popup like if you wanted to use pause (i will give a quick explonation under here even tho its not in the code) it would not popup with the "the text is closed"

pause >nul

pause -- used to pause the whole code

pause
:something -- this is a section and can be used to move to differant sections or a command

:start

goto -- this is used for the sections and you can code it so it can go back to start or another section of your chosing

goto start

if %something% == password-or-username goto start -- this is a username or password section where you can make it so you lock the code or have multiple options like exit and stuff

if %something% == password-or-username goto exit

close/exit -- closes the cmd/terminal

exit
close

chcp 65001 >nul -- kinda forgot what it is used for but it is really usefull to have it in your code. (edit.. from what i remember it is used if you want text art or stuff in your code. but keep it even if you dont)

chcp 65001 >nul

set /p something=Put a key or pass word or whatever here: -- MAKE SURE THERE IS A SPACE AFTER THE COLIN. This is used for people to write a password or username before the if cmd.

set /p key=Put something here: 
if %key% == put-a-user/pass-here goto start

That is all used in this code but if you still need help i suggest watching this guy + he was the person who taught me how to code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_NleTGYE24&list=PL35B3EFC3D6CD1DF7
